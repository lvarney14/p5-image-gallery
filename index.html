    <img src="img/img3.jpg" alt=""/>
    <p>He doesn’t use photoshop, nails, or wires to stage these stunning formations. He uses an “adhesive” as old as earth itself, something he likes to call gravity glue.

    <h2>Hidden Messages in Cartoons</h2>
    <img src="img/img9.jpg" alt=""/>
    <p>Everyone loves cartoons – both children and adults. There is always a temptation by a cartoonist to slip in a bit of something extra – something only they are aware of, but thanks to scores of teenaged boys with a pause button and too much time on their hands, we are all able to see these little in-jokes. Unfortunately for companies like Disney, some of them are a little on the naughty side and they have been the root of legal battles.</p><a class="more-link block-button" href="http://www.fascinatingpics.com/hidden-messages-in-cartoons/">Continue reading »</a>

    <p>Do you remember those imaginative doodles you used to make in your high school notebook? Maybe you still make them.

His most recent work is called “Time Guardian.” This stunning portrait of an owl features an unexpected twist – the whole thing is drawn out of minutely detailed gears, cogs and other mechanical bits, giving the soaring owl an intricate steampunk look…But the others are awesome too!</p><a class="more-link block-button" href="http://www.fascinatingpics.com/impressively-detailed-pen-doodles/">Continue reading »</a>
